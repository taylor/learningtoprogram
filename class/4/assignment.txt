We will be building a catalog system spread over the classes.  We will begin
with the ability to add books and list books.

Create 2 files in your students/<YOURNAME>/ directory, addbook.rb and listbooks.rb.

== Description ==

Description of addbook.rb
  - Show a welcome message and a description when the program starts
  - Open the book list file for writing
  - Start a loop
  - Prompt user to enter a book title or quit
  - If the user types quit
    * Then break from the loop
    * Close the book list file
  - Prompt the user to enter the author of the book
  - Output the title and author separated by a pipe '|' - Example: The Frog Splats When Thrown Against the Wall | Ms Japanese
  - Each book should be on a line by itself

Description of listbooks.rb
  - Use readlines or read from the File class/object to read all lines and
    display them.


== Sharing the new source code ==

Be sure add run

  git add addbook.rb listbooks.rb

to add the files for upload.  After editing the files run

  git commit -m "message about editing or changing addbook" addbook.rb 
  git commit -m "message about editing or changing listbooks" listbooks.rb

You could also do that in one line like this

  git commit -m "message about editing both addbook and listbooks" addbook.rb listbooks.rb

After commiting all changes when you are ready to upload run

  git pull

to pull any changes that have happened from others and bring your files up to date, then run

  git push
