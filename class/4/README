During this class we explored Ruby File IO, variables are references, Loops,
and decided on a project to work on as we move forward.

For File IO we first looked at how to create a new file using File.new() with
the correct options.   We discussed using puts to send output to the file and
closing it when done.

We then showed using File.new for opening a file for reading and then using
gets to retrieve some data from that file.

After that we continued with using File.open with a block as well as the read
and readlines methods.

Because we are dealing with more than "simple data" assigned to variables such
as strings and numbers, we went over how variables just point an object and do
not contain the data themselves.

We showed the Ruby's loop and how it works with blocks as well as how to break
from the loop.
